<h4>
Notes:
</h4>

<ul>
<li> Be careful with spellings and syntax. Your safest bet is all lowercase letters and digit numbers with no spaces or non alpha-numeric characters.  
<li> You will not be reshown the reward clues so make sure to keep note of them.
<li> I would advise having a pen & paper handy, some puzzles will be much easier if you write them down
<li> Please don't reveal any answers to other visitors, let them play for themselves.
<li> Some puzzles will have multiple stages.
<li> While you may have to use Google, or even an ancient device known as a 'book', to find some answers, please try to use your own brain first.
<li> If you believe you have the right answer but can't get the exact spelling, contact me with your answer, if you are close enough to the correct answer I'll give you the exact answer.
<li> I am aware of a few ways to cheat for anybody familiar with web structure but please refrain from doing any of these, it's just a d*ck move.
<li> I had a little fun writing responses to joke answers, see if you can trigger some of them.
<li> If you hate me at the end of this, I completely understand.
